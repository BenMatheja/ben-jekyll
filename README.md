# Jekyll-Bootstrap

The quickest way to start and publish your Jekyll powered blog. 100% compatible with GitHub pages

## Usage
Requires Ruby 2.2.1
`cd assets && bower install`
## Version

0.3.0 - stable and versioned using [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

**NOTE:** 0.3.0 introduces a new theme which is not backwards compatible in the sense it won't _look_ like the old version.
However, the actual API has not changed at all.
You might want to run 0.3.0 in a branch to make sure you are ok with the theme design changes.

## Milestones

[0.4.0](https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap/milestones/v%200.4.0) - next release [ETA 03/29/2015]

### GOALS

* No open PRs against master branch.

## Contributing


To contribute to the framework please make sure to checkout your branch based on `jb-development`!!
This is very important as it allows me to accept your pull request without having to publish a public version release.

Small, atomic Features, bugs, etc.
Use the `jb-development` branch but note it will likely change fast as pull requests are accepted.
Please rebase as often as possible when working.
Work on small, atomic features/bugs to avoid upstream commits affecting/breaking your development work.

For Big Features or major API extensions/edits:
This is the one case where I'll accept pull-requests based off the master branch.
This allows you to work in isolation but it means I'll have to manually merge your work into the next public release.
Translation : it might take a bit longer so please be patient! (but sincerely thank you).

# Jekyll Rake Boilerplate

*Jekyll Rake Boilerplate* is a small rake "boilerplate" for doing common tasks with the static site generator [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll"), such as generating your site, preview it in your default browser, creating a new post or page from a default template and transfering it to a remote git repository, a remote host/server or a local git repository.

Please note that the code is intentionally "messy" and quite un-DRY so that'll be easier to take the parts that you want and toss away the others.

## Usage

### Tasks

    rake post["Title"]
	rake draft["Title"]
	rake publish
    rake page["Title"]
        rake page["Title","Path/to/folder"]
    rake build
    rake watch
        rake watch[number]
        rake watch["drafts"]
    rake preview
    rake deploy["Commit message"]
    rake transfer

`rake post["Title"]` creates a new post in the `_posts` directory by reading the default template file, adding the title you've specified and generating a filename by using the current date and the title.

`rake draft["Title"]` creates a new post in the `_drafts` directory by reading the default template file, adding the title you've specified and generating a filename.

`rake publish` moves a post from the `_drafts` directory to the `_posts` directory and appends the current date to it. It'll list all drafts and then you'll get to choose which draft to move by providing a number.

`rake page["Title","path/to/folder"]` creates a new page. If the file path is not specified the page will get placed in the site's source directory.

`rake build` just generates the site.

`rake watch` generates the site and watches it for changes. If you want to generate it with a post limit, use `rake watch[1]` or whatever number of posts you want to see. If you want to generate your site with your drafts, use `rake watch["drafts"]`.

`rake preview` launches your default browser and then builds, serves and watches the site.

`rake deploy["Commit message"]` adds, commits and pushes your site to the site's remote git repository with the commit message you've specified. It also uses the `rake build` task to generate the site before it goes through the whole git process.

`rake transfer` uses either `robocopy` or `rsync` to transfer your site to a remote host/server or a local git repository. It also uses the `rake build` task to generate the site before it goes through the whole transfering process.

### Remote transfer settings (for Windows)

    transfer:
      command: robocopy
      settings: /mir
      source: _site\
      destination: username@servername:\var\www\websitename\

### Remote transfer settings (for *nix)

    transfer:
      command: rsync
      settings: -av --delete
      source: _site/
      destination: username@servername:/var/www/websitename/

### Local transfer settings (for Windows)

    transfer:
      command: robocopy
      settings: /e
      source: _site\
      destination: C:\Git\username.github.com\

### Local transfer settings (for *nix)

    transfer:
      command: rsync
      settings: -av
      source: _site/
      destination: ~/Git/username.github.com/

## Known issues

Rake tasks doesn't play nice when it comes to including commas in arguments. For example, if you try to create a post by running `post["One, two, three"]` the name and title of the post will become `One`. The easiest work-around for this is to skip the commas when your creating a post and adding them later on.
