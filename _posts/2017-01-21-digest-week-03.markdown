This week I changed my blogging-plattform from [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com) to [Jekyll](http://jekyll.com).
In the process of changing the overall design, i got really fed up with the structure and the overhead of functions the application is throwing on the user.

For my case a simple static site generator like [Jekyll](http://jekyll.com) seems to be perfect.
Everything under my own control and the [liquid templating engine](http://liquidmarkup.org/) is really intuitive and fun to use.

####Ramblings by Rasmus Andersson
The Blog of Rasmus Andersson is really interesting. I stumbled upon it while looking for jekyll sample pages.
Rasmus has been Designer at [Spotify](http://spotify.com), [Facebook](http://facebook.com) and is no working at [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com). There are a bunch of interesting stories and projects on his page - see for yourself.

####Immutable Infrastructure and Containers
The second element of this weeks digest is about the *immutable infrastructure* and the benefits this concept can provide using broad implementation of Containers.
Also in the light of the [Dockercon](http://www.dockercon.com/) taking place on June 22nd and June 23rd, 2015 a good read to catch up on this topic.

####High-end cloud gaming on demand
Larry Gadea, the foudner of [Envoy](www.envoy.co) features a really interesting article for all of the passionate part-time gamers. He provided the steps nescessary to use the Amazon AWS service, a VPN and the built-in Steam functionality to play latest games remotely on limited hardware like an MacBook Air.

####Card expansion effect SVG tutorial
Claudio Calautti shared a beautiful tutorial how to realize a card expansion effect with SVG clipPath. Maybe something i'll consider applying here later on.
